# Shed

Shed is meant as a stdlib for all TS projects under the @software-gardeners banner.
It takes inspiration and borrows (sometimes to the point of outright plagiarism) from great libraries such as [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/) and [effect](https://www.effect.website).

## Words of warning

It is not ready for production. Please do not use. You've been warned.
